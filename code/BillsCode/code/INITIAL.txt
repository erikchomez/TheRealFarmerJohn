GAME MECHANICS:
HYDRATED WATER MAKES SEED GROW FASTER
WATER HYDRATES 4 BLOCKS IN EACH DIRECTION
FARMLAND DECAYS IF DEHYDRATED AND NOTHING PLANTED
FULLY GROWN WHEAT YIELDS 0-3 SEEDS PER CROP, 2.5 SEED ARVERAGE
"AGE 7" WHEAT YIELDS 1 WHEAT + SEEDS, REST YIELDS 1 SEED
HARVESTING EARLY DROPS 1 WHEAT NO SEEDS
FARMLAND REVERTED TO DIRT IF JUMPED ON
- DROPS AS IF HARVESTED
REQUIRES LEVEL 9 LIGHT, AND WE ARE USING NATURAL SUNLIGHT ONLY
GROWTH HAPPENS AT RANDOM INTERVALS AFFECTED BY GORWING CONDITIONS
5-35 IN GAME MINUTES PER STAGE

To fully grow a wheat crop it can take from 24,000 ticks to 72,000 ticks. 
Ticks are the time period in Minecraft and 1 tick is equal to 0.05 seconds. 
In Minecraft, a game tick represents one game loop run. 
A game day in the game lasts exactly 24000 ticks, or 20 minutes, as the speed of the game is fixed at 20 ticks per second.

It takes at least 60 minutes for the wheat to grow in Minecraft.  Sometimes it grows faster and some slower but approximately 60 minutes is a good amount of time. To harvest in the minimum time possible, wheat seeds need to be sown under an open sky and with a block of water nearby it.

NEED ENOUGH TIME FOR WHEAT TO GROW
- BUT CONSTRAINT TIME SO THAT HYDRATED WHEAT GROWS BEFORE DRY WHEAT

DEPENDING ON VARIOUS CONDITIONS GROWTH IS AFFECTED:

OUR APPROACH:
TEACH SOWING SEEDS AND USING HOE -> REWARD PLANTING SEEDS, NOT GETTING STUCK IN WATER, NOT LEAVING BOUNDARIES
TEACH HARVESTING CROPS AND IMPORTANCE OF LOCATION -> REWARD HARVEST WHEAT, MORE RESOURCES TO GET TO WHEAWT
TEACH CONSTRAINTS AND EFFIENCY -> CUT TIME, CUT LAND, CUT RESOURCES, AGENT MUST NOW PLANT QUICKLY AND HARVEST QUICKLY
- UNDERSTAND CROPS GROW FASTER NEAR WATER
- UNDERSTAND CROPS TAKE TIME TO GROW AND SHOULD NOT BE HARVEST EARLY
- DO SO WITH LIMITED RESOURCES

APPLICATION: "NATURAL" ISLAND, AGENT MUST PLANT SEEDS TO "SURVIVE"
