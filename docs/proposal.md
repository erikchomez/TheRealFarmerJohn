## Summary of the Project
The goal of this project is to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on real world terrain data and generate new terrains visualized in Minecraft. 

Terrain generation is useful in world building. Generating terrains from real world data can be used in augmented reality, as well as world building in video games. 

## AI/ML Algorithms
Our team anticipates using a GAN, employing two deep neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that work against each other during model training.

## Evaluation Plan
The quantitative metrics we plan to evaluate are the accuracy of the agent's generated terrains, which can be measured as a % of generated blocks to terrain data.

We will be able to qualitatively measure the success of our GAN based on how effectively it produced the terrains. Since our GAN will generate voxel models, importing them to Minecraft will be our way to verify it works. Our moonshot case would be to create a GAN capable of procedural generation of larger, more expansive models based on the training data.

## Appointment with the Instructor
We plan on meeting with the instructor on Thursday October 14 @ 2:15pm.
