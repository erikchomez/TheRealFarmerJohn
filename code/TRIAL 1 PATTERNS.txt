PATTERNS OBSERVED:
MARSHLAND VS DRYLAND
MARSHLAND NEAR SPAWN DUE TO ISSUES IN RANDOM GENERATION, DRYLAND IN EDGES
SPAWN IN MARSH
PLANT RAPIDLY
ONCE TOO MANY POINTS ARE LOST FROM PLANTING / BREAKING / REPLANTING, MOVE TO DRYLAND
A BIT OF PLANTING AND HOEING IN DRYLAND, BUT MUCH LESS THAN MARSH
RETURN TO MARSH NEAR THE END OF TIME TO HARVEST
DEVELOPED THIS PATTERN RAPIDLY, OFTEN WITHIN 5-10 EPISODES
HARVESTS VERY LATE (LAST 25% OF TIME) FOR MAJORITY OF WHEAT, SOMETHIMES WITHIN EVEN 1%
HARVESTING IN 2 WAVES, MOST IN SECOND
HARVESTING TENDS TO BE RANDOM, SOMETIMES BREAKING DIRT AND PLACING
FEW "ESCAPES" -> TEACH TO STAY IN NEARBY AREA
TIME ALLOTED CHOSEN BECAUSE HOE WOULD BREAK A LITTLE AFTER THIS TIME, BUT ENOUGH FOR A LITTLE OVER TWO FULL GROWTH CYCLES

PURPOSELY LEFT 2 SLOT OPEN, AGENT NEVER RAN OUT OF SEEDS AND CAN SEE NUMBER OF WHEAT EVEN IF HOLDING DIRT BY ACCIDENT

NO SUICIDE DEATHS FROM STARVATION + JUMPING OFF TALL DIRT TOWERS

BETTER AT PLANTING -> BETTER AT HARVESTING

NEAR 70000 STEPS, REGULARLY BREAKS DIAMOND HOE AT 30%

REWARDS: 
PLANTING SEED +2, 
COLLECTING WHEAT +100

PENALTIES: 
STEPPING ON WATER -10
COLLECTING DIRT -1
COLLECTING SEED -5 (FROM STOMPING, BUT ALSO SMALL AMT FROM HARVESTING)

ISSUES:
TRIAL ENDED EARLY DUE TO DIAMOND HOE BREAKING CONSISTENTLY -> SOMEWHAT POSITIVE EFFECT AS ENCOURAGED HARVESTING
NEEDS REASONABLE TIME FOR PLANTS TO GROW MEANING TRIALS ARE LONG
"ESCAPES"
END GOAL IS BEING ABLE TO USE IT IN NATURALLY GENERATED WORLDS WITHOUT DROWNING
HYDROPHOBIA / HYDROPHILIA (GETTING STUCK IN WATER, BUT FERTILIZED SOIL MAKES CROPS GROW FASTER)
PRIOITIZING PLANTING OVER HARVESTING

FUTURE ITERATION:
REMOVE OR LESSEN REWARDS GIVEN FOR PLANTING SEED TO AVOID PLANT NOT HARVEST STRATEGY
INCREASE PENALTY FOR COLLECTING SEED
INCREASE PENALTY FOR COLLECTING / PLACING DIRT
LESSEN PENALTY FOR STEPPING ON WATER
MAKE ESCAPE PENALTY VERY HIGH
LOWER AVAILABLE TIME (TO PRESSURE TIMELY HARVESTING)
ADDITIONAL DIAMOND HOE, ONE LESS SEED STACK (ALL NOT BEING USED)
