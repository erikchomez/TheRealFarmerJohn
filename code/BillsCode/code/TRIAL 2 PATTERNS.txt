CHANGES MADE:

(CHANGED = *)
REWARDS: 
PLANTING SEED +1*
COLLECTING WHEAT +100

PENALTIES:
STEPPING ON WATER -2*
STEPPING ON COBBLESTONE -100*
PLACING DIRT -10*
COLLECTING DIRT -5*
COLLECTING SEED -2*

SEED STACK REMOVED, TWO SLOTS OPEN
- ONE FOR VIEWING WHEAT, ONE FOR DIRT*
ONE SEED STACK CHANGED TO DIAMOND HOE*
2 DIAMOND HOE, 5 SEED STACKS, EMPTY WHEAT SLOT, EMPTY DIRT SLOT

TIME STILL 10000000MS
SLEEP CUT IN HALF TO 0.001

WATER DENSITY KEPT
WATER STILL CONCENTRATED NEAR SPAWN
NOW REPLENISHING HUNGER CONSTANTLY

USING CHECKPOINT FROM TRIAL 1

OBSERVATIONS:
NOW BREAKS BOTH DIAMOND HOES AND USES ALL SEEDS EXTREMELY QUICKLY 
- EVENTUALLY BREAKING AND RECOLLECTING UP TO A STACK DURING HARVESTING
VERY FAST PLANTING / HOEING (BREAKS BOTH HOES AND USES ALL SEEDS BEFORE 3K STEPS REMAINING)
COLLECTS MORE WHEAT (AVG 30-40)
WANDERS AROUND COLLECTING WHEAT ONLY WHEN BOTH DIAMOND HOES BROKEN
WASTES A LOT OF SEEDS IN DRYLANDS, MOST DON'T GROW
AS BAR CAN ONLY HOLD SO MUCH ITEMS, SOLUTION IS TO DOWNSIZE FARM (CURRENTLY 50X50, 2500 BLOCKS)

AGENT SOMEHOW FIGURED OUT WATER FERTIIZES SOIL, PLANTS HEAVILY IN THOSE AREAS
DOES NOT EFFICIENCY HARVEST THE WHEAT, BREAKS TOO EARLY OR DOES NOT BREAK

NO WAY FOR AGENT TO DIFFERENTIATE GROWN VS UNGROWN WHEAT IN OBSERVATION
NO WAY FOR AGENT TO DIFFERENTIATE FERTILE FARMLAND AND REGULAR

REWARDING WATER COULD CAUSE HYDROPHILIA, CAUSING AGENT TO ASSOCIATE WHEAT/REWARDS WITH WATER OBSERVED AREAS
ARTIFICIALLY CREATED LINK

FUTURE CHANGES:
LOWER TIME
REWARD FOR STEPPING ON FARMLAND TO ENCOURAGE STAYING NEAR FARMLAND INSTEAD OF VENTURING TO DRYLAND
NO REWARDS FOR SEEDS
INCREASE PENALTY FOR COLLECTING SEEDS (AVOID WASTING TIME TO REPLANT)
FOCUS ON HARVESTING OVER EVERYTHING
ENOURAGE WATER INSTEAD OF PENALIZING
DOWNSIZE FARM TO 25X25, 25% OF ORIGINAL FARM WITH SAME WATER DENSITY (10%)
BACK TO 1 DIAMOND HOE AND 3 STACKS OF SEEDS TO TEACH EFFICIENCY AND PLANTING NEAR WATER

NEXT STEP:
NOW THAT AGENT UNDERSTANDS TO PLANT NEAR WATER AND TO PLANT / FERTILIZE DIRT
FOCUS ON HARVESTING WITHOUT BREAKING PREMATURE CROP
