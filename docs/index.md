## Summary

The goal of our project is to create an agent that is able to grow wheat and harvest it at the right time. We put a time constraint on the agent to see if it can maximize the amount of wheat in that time frame. Initially, the agent starts off in a controlled environment with the tools necessary to grow wheat and create farmland. Then we change the complexity of the training by looking at the previous rewards and determine the next level of training.
