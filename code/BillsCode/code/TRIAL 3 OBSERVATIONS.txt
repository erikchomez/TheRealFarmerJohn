ENVIRONMENT AFFECTING AGENT <-> AGENT AFFECTING ENVIRONMENT

AGENT NOW FORCED UNDER TIME, SPACE, RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS
- 3 STACKS OF SEEDS
- 1 DIAMOND HOE
- 25% LAND
- 50% TIME

REWARDS:
WHEAT +100
STEPPING ON WATER +1
//STEPPING ON FARMLAND +1 - ISSUE: AGENT WOULD CREATE FARMLAND IN DRYLAND AND RUN AROUND IT IN CIRCLES TO GATHER POINTS

PENALTIES:
BREAKING DIRT -10
USING DIRT -10
STEPPING ON COBBLESTONE -100
COLLECTING WHEAT SEEDS -2

REASONING:
FORCING AGENT TO BE EFFICIENT WITH PLANTING BY PENALIZING BREAKING GROWING WHEAT, BUT NOT REWARDING PLANTING
REWARDING WATER LIGHTLY TO LEAD AWAY FROM INEFFICIENT GROWTH OR WANDERING
PENALIZING INEFFICIENT BEHAVIOR SUCH AS BREAKING AND PLACING DIRT OR ESCAPING
AGENT WILL TRY TO GROW FROM "CENTER OUT" WHERE THE WATER IS AND AVOID OUTSKIRTS WHERE BORDERS AND DRYLAND ARE

OBSERVATIONS:
ESCAPE(S) - DUE TO SPACE CONSTRAINT AND "WAITING" 
DIFFICULTY IN PLANTING FAST ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR LARGE HARVESTS
EXTREMELY LOW REWARDS TO PENALTY RATIO -> INCITE "FEAR"
AGENT REPEATEDLY HARVESTS CROPS BEFORE GROWTH 
GETS "CONFUSED" WHEN PENALIZED AND QUICKLY REPLANTS TO GET REWARDS (THAT ARE NO LONGER THERE)
STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT TO DO WHILE CROPS ARE GROWING (AND HOE IS BROKEN)

AGENT GOES BACK IN ONCE IN A WHILE TO BREAK A FEW WHEAT, IF GATHERS WHEAT GOES IN A BREAKS MANY
AGENT SEEMS TO BELIEVE IF ONE OR TWO IS READY THE REST WILL BE AS IS UNABLE TO DETECT DIFFERENT STAGES OF WHEAT
IF BREAKS AND GATHERS SEED, GOES BACK TO WANDERING OUTSKIRTS MAKING FARMLAND TO GATHER POINTS
METHOD OF MAXIMIZING POINTS WHILE WAITING FOR CROPS IS MAKING FARMLAND IN OUTSKIRTS AND RUNNING AROUND THEM

ISSUES:
WEIRD BUG CAUSING MASSIVE REWARD LOSS IN LATE EPISODE
SERVER SLOWING DOWN MASSIVELY OVER TIME
TIME CONSTRAINT MAY HAVE BEEN TOO TIGHT FOR AGENT
SMALLER MAP CAUSING TO INCREASED ESCAPES

LAST TRIAL:
LAKE ON CENTER OF MAP STILL 10% WATER DENSITY
ONLY REWARD WHEAT
"APPLICABILITY"
LIMITED RESOURCES
ORIGINAL TIME
AGENT NO LONGER PENALIZED FOR COLLECTING SEED
MUST COLLECT AND REPLANT AS MANY TIMES AS POSSIBLE TO MAXIMIZE WHEAT
