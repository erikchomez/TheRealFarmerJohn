## Summary of the Project
The goal of this project is to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on real world terrain data and generate new terrains visualized in Minecraft. 

Terrain generation is useful in world building. Generating terrains from real world data can be used in augmented reality, as well as world building in video games. 

## AI/ML Algorithms
Our team anticipates using a GAN, employing two deep neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that work against each other during model training.

## Evaluation Plan
The quantitative metrics we plan to evaluate are the accuracy of the agent's generated terrains, which can be measured as a % of generated blocks to terrain data.
