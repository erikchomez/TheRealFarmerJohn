ISLAND SETUP:
30X30 WORLD
1 WIDTH RING OVER WATER OUTSIDE BEFORE FENCE
SMALL 6X6 WATER "LAKE" IN MIDDLE

8 "RINGS" OF FERTILE LAND, 4 ON OUTSIDE AND 4 ON INSIDE
15 "RINGS" OF UNFERTILE LAND BETWEEN

NO REWARDS / PENALTIES FOR ANYTHING ELSE THAN WHEAT

ISSUES:
REWARDS ARE OFTEN NOT COUNTING PROPERLY, DUE TO FAST TICKRATE (MENTIONED BY KOLBY IN EDSTEM)
HOWEVER, DUE TO LENGTH OF MISSIONS WE STILL NEED FAST TICKRATES
AT THIS POINT, WE ARE OUT OF TIME... WILL HAVE THE MENTION IT IN VIDEO

HARVESTING:
JUMPING INSTEAD OF BREAKING TO HARVEST
- LESS DURABILITY LOSS ON HOE
- BREAKING / PLACING DIRT HEAVILY PENALIZED PREVIOUSLY
- FASTER PICKUP AND MOVEMENT
